# CMPE131_Liftsy_10
CMPE 131 Software Implementation Part 2

The repo contains 2 different version for part 2.
1. The package with working sign-in and pre-created users (from previous assignment)
2. LiftsySignUp - contains the old index.html files. Added Index2.html 
     *  When running Index.html and pressing "Sign Up" buttons it routs to index2.html that contains the body for a user to create a username and password. 
     * Getting stuck after that. Can't get the DAO file to work and talk to the databasae. 
     * Additionally created Signup.html in this package. The code uses google firebase template code for sign-up/sign in page.
